Script to create SCADA WinCC Professional tags using Python

This script create Siemens WinCC Professional tags with information read from a text document. The information is saved in a .xlsx that can be imported in TIA Portal tags importation. It can save you a lot of time!   

I've used the SampleDocument.txt as source of information. It's also in this repository.
